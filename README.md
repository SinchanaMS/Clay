# Clay

Clay is an open-source lightweight CSS styling framework that helps you mould your project with ease and convenience. It reduces the effort of having to style the components and design the layouts of your webpage.
By using Clay, you can focus on the functionality of the website rather than the design.

## Usage
To install Clay, paste the below code in the <head> section of your HTML code.

      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://clay-ui.netlify.app/stylesheets/index.css">
      
## Alternative
Add the following import to your CSS file at the top before all other CSS file imports.

    @import url("https://clay-ui.netlify.app/stylesheets/index.css");
